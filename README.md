# Maze Solver

[Boot.dev](https://www.boot.dev) project for visualizing depth first search algorithms.

This project is built on top of tkinter and ttkbootstap. Upon running `main.py`
a tkinter window will appear with a few buttons for configure the size of maze you
want to see. The maze will be generated in real time via a depth first search algorithm.

After the maze finishes drawing you can watch another DFS algorithm attempt to solve the maze.

You can create a wide range of maze sizes up to 100 x 100 cell mazes

## Installation and Dependecies

The only dependency for this project is `ttkbootstrap` which can be installed
with:

`pip install ttkbootsrap`

## Running

You can run the project with the following command:

`python3 main.py`
